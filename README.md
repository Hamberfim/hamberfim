<span style="white-space: nowrap;">I solve new problems creatively in controlled, calculated, and organized ways. Deliberate in my planning, and I think before acting. I do my homework and have a high degree of curiosity about many areas. I enjoy learning for learningâ€™s sake, and I become competent in the things I choose to learn. I am a strong stabilizing force on a team during high-pressure projects, a team player and I support the cause without hidden agendas. </span><br/>
