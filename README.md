### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Anthony. 
:man_technologist: <strong>I'm a Developer (& Photographer, Graphic Artist) interested in creating things that have a positive impact on our world.</strong> âš¡ <br/>
I solve new problems creatively in controlled, calculated, and organized ways. Deliberate in my planning, and I think before acting. I do my homework and have a high degree of curiosity about many areas. I enjoy learning for learningâ€™s sake, and I become competent in the things I choose to learn. I am a strong stabilizing force on a team during high-pressure projects, a team player and I support the cause without hidden agendas. <br/>
